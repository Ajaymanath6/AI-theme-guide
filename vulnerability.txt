SECURITY AUDIT REPORT
=====================
Project: angular-tailwind-flowbite-app
Date: Initial Setup
Status: No critical vulnerabilities found

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
------------------------

1. EXTERNAL CDN DEPENDENCY
   - File: src/index.html
   - Issue: Flowbite JavaScript is loaded from CDN (cdn.jsdelivr.net)
   - Risk Level: LOW (for development)
   - Recommendation: 
     * For production, consider bundling Flowbite with the application
     * Use npm package instead of CDN to ensure version control and integrity
     * Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) if CDN must be used
   - Action Required: Review CDN usage before production deployment

2. NO HARDCODED SECRETS FOUND
   - Status: PASSED
   - No API keys, passwords, tokens, or credentials found in source code
   - All configuration appears to be environment-agnostic

3. DEPENDENCY VULNERABILITIES
   - Status: Initial setup complete
   - Recommendation: Run `npm audit` regularly to check for known vulnerabilities
   - Command: `npm audit` or `npm audit fix`

4. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   - Status: No environment variables configured yet
   - Recommendation: When adding API keys or secrets, use environment variables
   - Create .env file (and add to .gitignore) for sensitive configuration

5. CONTENT SECURITY POLICY (CSP)
   - Status: Not configured
   - Recommendation: Implement CSP headers in production to prevent XSS attacks
   - Consider adding meta tags or server-side headers

6. HTTPS
   - Status: Development setup (HTTP)
   - Recommendation: Always use HTTPS in production environments

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS BEFORE PRODUCTION:
--------------------------------------
1. Replace CDN script with npm package bundling
2. Run `npm audit` and fix any vulnerabilities
3. Configure environment variables for sensitive data
4. Implement Content Security Policy
5. Enable HTTPS
6. Review and update all dependencies to latest secure versions
7. Add .env to .gitignore if using environment variables
8. Consider implementing rate limiting for API calls
9. Review Angular security best practices documentation

NOTES:
------
- This is an initial setup audit
- Regular security audits should be performed
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow Angular security guidelines: https://angular.io/guide/security
